# Web-Scraping-Challenge

In this challenge, multiple tools including, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Splinter were used to extract data from websites to derive valualbe information.

Part 1: Mars News
I accessed the website virtually and looped through the articles scraping their titles and preview texts organizing them in a python dictionary. Then I wrote the dictionary into a new json file. 

Part 2: Mars Weather
Similar to the first part, I accessed the website and found data from a table. From the data extracted I answered these questions:

1. How many months on Mars?
  12 months
2. How many Martian days of data are there?
  1,867 days
3. What are the coldest and warmest months on Mars?
  Coldest: Month 3
  Warmest: Month 8
4. Which months have the hightest and lowest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
  Hightest: Month 9
  Lowest: Month 6
5. About how many Earth days exist in a Martian year?
